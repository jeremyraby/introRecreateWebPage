# Intro to HTML Assignment - Recreate Web Page

This project is one of the first HTML projects in Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy. I'd previously done this project several months ago, but I'm re-doing it and including it for two reasons:

      - Trying to get back into front-end dev practice
      - More practice using git and GitHub
